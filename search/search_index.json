Furthermore, when Pyratite is used as ammo, it will burn enemies faster and stronger than Blast Compound. When Lava is used as an ammo in the Wave, it will burn enemies unlike Cryofluid or Oil.</p> <p>Tip: Make sure distribution blocks (Conveyors, Vaults, Bridges) that contain flammable or explosive materials are protected and kept away from potential damage, like a Reactor or enemy path.

In this example, the drill will put Lead on all 7 conveyors, but not the eight one because that conveyor moves towards the drill. The drill will prioritize each path evenly. If a path is blocked, it is not considered as an output.</p> <p>Notice that a conveyor moving into the Core deposits the material into the core inventory. Once a material is in the Core inventory, you can use it to build immediately, regardless of location. </p> <p>2. Conveyors moving towards a block will be an input for the block (only if applicable). </p> <p></p> <p>In this example, a Smelter is turning 2 Lead, 1 Copper, and 1 Coal into 1 Dense Alloy.

(This concept also applies for liquids, also covered later)</p> <p>3. Blocks that output can directly place into other blocks.</p> <p></p> <p>This last example is a Pneumatic Drill mining stone and using a Pulverizer to turn it into sand. A pulverizer turns stone into sand by using power.

Having copper income is the very first thing you need to set up, because all drills and conveyors use copper. </p> <p>To mine, tap on a single ore square. The mech will start mining with a laser. You will see ore flying out of the patch. </p> <p></p> <p>If a mine (any ore square) is close enough to your core, the items will automatically fly right to the core. If a mine is not close enough, the mined ore will fly onto your mech. There is not a good way to determine how much ore your mech is carrying, but your mech will stop mining once it is full. You will also notice that your mech is much slower than before.</p> <p>You can only hold one type of material at a time.</p> <p>To drop off the mined ore or current mech inventory, on mobile, tap and hold on a spot near your mech. On desktop, drag from your mech to the recipient. A small icon (a circle with the ore icon) will appear. The recipient block will display its outline if it can accept the item. Drag this over the core to deposit it in the core inventory. Drag it into any block which accepts the item to drop it off in the block. Drag it to an empty space to discard it. </p> <p></p> <p>You can pick things off of a conveyor. Click on the conveyor. The conveyor contents will show up. Tap/click on the icon to pick it off the belt and add it to your mech's inventory. This is very useful when there is one item blocking the path due to a contamination or error. You can also take items out of any block that accepts or produces items.</p> <p></p> <p>In the above example, the Smelter cannot produce Dense Alloy because it lacks Copper. Why?
